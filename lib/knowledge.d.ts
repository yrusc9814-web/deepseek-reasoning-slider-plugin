/**
 * Built-in model knowledge base for reasoning-effort guidance.
 *
 * Each entry names the display levels (`efforts` keys, the DSH level
 * universe) a model really offers and the wire value the endpoint accepts
 * (`efforts` values). Levels not named are pinned unsupported by
 * `dsh-llm-pi-ai`'s resolution, so an entry with `{ low, high }` offers
 * exactly those two and never a guessed third.
 *
 * The Host half uses these entries ONLY to generate copy-ready YAML for
 * custom-provider models the directory does not describe. It never writes
 * settings itself and never overrides catalog-declared levels.
 *
 * `compat` is only meaningful for `openai-completions` routes; the snippet
 * generator carries it onto those routes and drops it elsewhere.
